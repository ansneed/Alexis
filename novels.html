                    <p class="teaser">They had been eating lunch for two weeks in silence. She did not wish to ruin their strangely formed intimacy with words. She had said something to her, once, asking if she could sit next to her.</p>
<p class="teaser">The girl was voluntarily mute. She had seen her tongue flick out from her mouth while sipping tea, thus making her very capable of speech. There was the occasional guttural sound that erupted from the base of her throat, indicating the latent ability to speak.</p>
<p class="teaser">She had decided to give her the name Cassie. Her aunt and uncle had simply introduced the young woman as Ms. White. A fair creature with golden ringlets tied beautifully above the nape of her neck. Eyes a piercing blue. Cassandra had seemed almost too formal for this ethereal cherub, but it was her name sake. Cassie was exactly as she had imagined the doomed Trojan princess, Cassandra. One would have expected Cassandra’s reincarnation to be tan like an Arab, but her Cassandra had to be fair. She was a gifted, innocent girl, luminescent in white. Apollo had stolen this precious innocence and fated her to a life of true prophecies with no one believing her.</p>
<p class="teaser">At least, that was the story she told herself of Cassie’s muteness.</p>

Usually, it’s the children that experience this, filled to the brim with butter drenched pita and pastitsio. But, you could see it in adults as well: mothers bloated from a life in the kitchen, rewarding themselves with constant parcels of food for keeping their families well-nourished and fathers with swelling stomachs from working jobs that kept them stagnant all day. I have yet to be fat, so I know my day will come.</p>

I have found evidence of the divine – no doubt this will be discounted by science in the future. Ancient storm gods like Baal and Neptune predict this. Yet, divine it was. I write this but a mere after I met with this peculiar patient, this unique specimen with no traces of physical aging. </p>
